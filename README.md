# PantryPartnersApp

Pantry Partners is an operational support tool designed to help food banks monitor and manage real-time distribution conditions. The system collects data on wait times, food inventory, volunteer availability, and external factors such as weather. Pantry Partners presents this information through a dashboard, enabling staff to anticipate shortages, balance distribution across windows, and make quick adjustments during peak hours. Pantry Partners aims to reduce wait times, minimize waste, and ensure a smoother distribution process for volunteers and the community.

# Features
## Expected Wait Time:
This feature will calculate the wait time at any point in line based on people ahead, volunteers available, the speed of distribution, and food availability.


## Food Inventory:
This feature will show food supply throughout the day. It will decrease as food is given out and increase as food is donated.

## Hunger levels
People with different hunger amounts will affect the amount of food that each person gets

## Weather Adjusted Factors
The feature will adjust related factors (wait time, speed, etc) based on the severity of weather conditions (sunny days will be smoother, rainy days will be slower).

## Open or Closed
This feature will determine whether the food bank is open or closed. It also considers the operation hours of food banks. If it’s closed, people's hunger will build up.
