# PantryPartnersApp

Pantry Partners is an operational support tool designed to help food banks monitor and manage real-time distribution conditions. The system collects data on wait times, food inventory, volunteer availability, and external factors such as weather. Pantry Partners presents this information through a dashboard, enabling staff to anticipate shortages, balance distribution across windows, and make quick adjustments during peak hours. Pantry Partners aims to reduce wait times, minimize waste, and ensure a smoother distribution process for volunteers and the community.
